Hi, I’m Mohan Singh Parmar — a developer passionate about Web Development, Cyber Security, and AI-driven solutions.

With "1.5 years of experience in Web Development", I’ve worked with multiple clients and built clean, efficient, and user-focused applications.
Currently, I’m transitioning into "AI for CYBERSECURITY", exploring how machine learning can strengthen security systems and threat detection.

I believe in continuous learning, solving real-world problems, and building projects that reflect creativity, logic, and practical thinking.

If you're an experienced professional in Cybersecurity, I truly welcome any advice, guidance, or mentorship. I’m always open to learning from experts and improving my skills.
