Hi, I’m Mohan Singh Parmar — a developer passionate about Web Development, Cyber Security, and AI-driven solutions.

I enjoy building clean, efficient, and user-focused applications.
Currently, I’m transitioning into AI for Cybersecurity, exploring how machine learning can enhance modern security systems and threat detection.

I believe in continuous learning, solving real-world problems, and creating projects that reflect creativity, logic, and practical thinking.

If you're an experienced professional in Cybersecurity, I’d truly appreciate any advice, guidance, or mentorship you’d like to share. I’m always open to learning from experts and improving my skills.
